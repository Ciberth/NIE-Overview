Note that when I use the term **"completed"**, I by no means suggest I covered everything concerning the subject. It only means I am done working on it for the time being. When it says **"coming up"**, I am planning on tackling it. **"In production"** means I am working on it right now. 


## Explanation

Hi there, if you've stumbled upon this page you are probably searching some information about a specific subject. In table above you can see which subjects I have finished or which I'm writing at the moment. In this section I try to explain my thoughtproces and the origin of the NIE-series. 


### Origin

When I was in college I had a very (for some weird but) special teacher. If you want to picture him, think about a mad scientist who is angry all the time (or at least it seems so to the outside world). The man has a unique way of teaching. Almost all his lessons were pretty chaotic while at the same time it was very clear what we had to finish in these hours. I still remember his first lesson were he astonished everyone by asking what a chair was (he wanted to make clear that we had to be very correct in everything we formulated). I won't write a book about him but I wanted you, the reader, to know that part of the reason I started thinking about the NIE-series is because of them. He printed the idea that literally nothing is easy at first and talking about stuff is only accesable when you indeed have some knowledge about the subject. 

### Nothing is easy? Really?

Yeah, yeah I know the phrase, or one-liner, "nothing is easy" is a bit clich√© and often dubbed wrong but think about it. Without prior knowledge about anything there is no way you have the ability to solve whatever we are discussing. That being said the NIE is actually more an attempt to wrong some words we use in our day to day conversations. In dutch there is this word called "gewoon" which you can translate to "ordinary", "just", "it's only that" (example: "I don't understand that exercise", "well you only have to fill in the numbers, it's (just) that (simple)"). I realise this might sound a bit strange in English but bear with me here for a minute.

A lot of people always get agitate or irritated when people ask something "easy" or silly. Think about your parents asking something computer related for example. Funny side note when I was showing some stuff to a person quite aged (he just started out learning and using a computer) and I asked him to move his mouse up. The person literally raised his mouse in the air (instead of the cursor). This shows that communication is one the most important things in learning and teaching. Now think again about the chair example and realise how awesome that teacher was ;).  


_Short notice in dutch:_

Denk eens aan het woord gewoon en probeer in je dagelijkse leven eens na te gaan hoeveel mensen (inclusief jezelf) het woord ten onrechte gebruiken! In 9 van de 10 gevallen kan je het woord gewoon (no pun intended) weglaten. In elke zin waar je gewoon zou kunnen vervangen door vanzelfsprekend of uiteraard of iets dergelijks moet je eens nagaan hoe nuttig het woord is in die zin? Probeer je hier aan te tonen dat de persoon waarmee je spreekt dom is of doe je het zonder er bij stil te staan? ;)

Obviously there is nothing wrong with being a the person who is ten times smarter then your environment and I honestly don't care if you want to be negative, toxic person. But what I do care is that people who want to learn something actually have the right to learn from scratch and that they are not tempted to give up because others reactie with a negative attitude.


### Writing a good course is hard

The last reason why I wanted to write my own series of courses is out of selfinterest: 
- I would love to teach so having courses or stuff to fall back to would be a nice thing to have;
- I hate a lot of documents, curriculums, courses I have or had at college/university (they are often incomplete, wrong, written from one point of view...)
- Summaries of the knowledge I need to acquire. **Repitition is the mother of our memory!**

## Contributions

If you see errors, wrong thought processes or if you have any remarks whatsoever please do not hesitate to contact me. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ciberth) or you can open an issue on this repository (or the specific NIE-repository). 

While I don't mind working in group, I do want to say that the NIE-repositories are my babies. Because of that I don't mind giving credit to whoever helps me as a contributor but I do not plan to work together with someone in such a way that we would be talking about co-authors. That being said I hope people are still encouraged to challenge themselves with this material and maybe extend in whatever way they seem fit.
